There is nothing wrong in having 10 examples in the same language for different frameworks/solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nEvery time I get a new job I am being thrown right into middle of the action. No tutorials, no babysitting - just a real project and a task to complete.\r\n\r\nIt is a very stressful and frustrating at the beginning - but - after a short while not only I have completed the task - but also have this feeling that in a month of practice I've learned more than in a year of solving theoretical and imaginary problems.\r\n\r\nSo - I've prepared an unfinished game - and a plot for you as a new employee. \r\nLet me know does it work and what was your experience with it.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
